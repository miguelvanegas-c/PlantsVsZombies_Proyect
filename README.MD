# POOB VS ZOMBIES
## Description
POOB vs Zombies is a real-time strategy video game inspired by the iconic Plants vs Zombies, originally created by George Fan and released by PopCap Games in 2009.
- The game contains some of the original plants, which are:
1. Peashooter
2. Wall-nut
3. Sunflower
4. Potato Mine
- It also contains some of the original zombies, which are:
1. Basic Zombie
2. Conehead Zombie
3. Buckethead Zombie
- Besides, a plant was designed which is *ECIPlant* Basically it is a sunflower but more powerful, since it produces larger and more valuable suns.
- And we also made the design of two zombies, which are:
1. *Brainstein* It is a zombie that will produce brains, which have a behavior similar to suns, but in this case will be used to generate zombies.
2. *ECIZombie* It is a zombie that will stay in the box in which it is generated and will throw bombs that will destroy the plants.
### Things to keep in mind:
Regardless of which mode you are playing, the game will ask you to fill in all the fields present in the settings, things like player name, number of starting suns, number of brains, game time, etc, any space that comes up on the screen (Note that when you enter a value you will need to press enter for the value to be taken).
## Game Modes
### PvsM
For the PvsM mode, it is the basic mode of the game, in which the player, managing the plants, is confronted with the zombies managed by the machine.
- To start the game, you will have to select a name and a number of initial suns, as well as select the plants you want to play with.
- Now for the zombies you will have to select between two types of machines, Original Zombies (which throws the zombies completely at random) and startegic zombies (which analyzes which row of plants is the weakest and attacks it), you need to select a starting time, and configure the hordes, setting a number of zombies per horde and the duration of the horde.
### MvsM
For this mode you will have to do the same process of PvsM, but in this case you will have to select the type of plant you want the machine to be, plants strategic or plant intelligent.
